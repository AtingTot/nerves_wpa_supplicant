  Tell the wpa_supplicant to connect to the specified network. Invoke
  like this:

      iex> Nerves.WpaSupplicant.set_network(pid, ssid: "MyNetworkSsid", key_mgmt: :WPA_PSK, psk: "secret")

  or like this:

      iex> Nerves.WpaSupplicant.set_network(pid, %{ssid: "MyNetworkSsid", key_mgmt: :WPA_PSK, psk: "secret"})

  Many options are supported, but it is likely that `ssid` and `psk` are
  the most useful. The full list can be found in the wpa_supplicant
  documentation. Here's a list of some common ones:

      Option                | Description
      ----------------------|------------
      :ssid                 | Network name. This is mandatory.
      :key_mgmt             | The security in use. This is mandatory. Set to :NONE, :WPA_PSK
      :proto                | Protocol use use. E.g., :WPA2
      :psk                  | WPA preshared key. 8-63 chars or the 64 char one as processed by `wpa_passphrase`
      :bssid                | Optional BSSID. If set, only associate with the AP with a matching BSSID
      :mode                 | Mode: 0 = infrastructure (default), 1 = ad-hoc, 2 = AP
      :frequency            | Channel frequency. e.g., 2412 for 802.11b/g channel 1
      :wep_key0..3          | Static WEP key
      :wep_tx_keyidx        | Default WEP key index (0 to 3)

  Note that this is a helper function that wraps several low-level calls and
  is limited to specifying only one network at a time. If you'd
  like to register multiple networks with the supplicant, send the
  ADD_NETWORK, SET_NETWORK, SELECT_NETWORK messages manually.
