# WpaSupplicant [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fhunleth/wpa_supplicant.ex.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fhunleth/wpa_supplicant.ex)

This package enables Elixir applications to interact with the local WPA
supplicant. The WPA supplicant handles various Wi-Fi operations like scanning
for wireless networks, connecting, authenticating, and collecting wireless
adapter statistics.

## Note on permissions

The `wpa_supplicant` daemon runs as root and requires processes that attach to
its control interface to be root. One way of doing this is to set the `wpa_ex`
binary to be setuid root. E.g.,

    chown root:root priv/wpa_ex
    chmod +s priv/wpa_ex

The `Makefile` has a `setuid` target that runs those commands. See the building
section.

## Building

Building `wpa_supplicant.ex` is similar to other Elixir projects. The Makefile
will invoke `mix` to compile both the Elixir and C source code. The only extra
step is to ensure that the permissions are right on the `wpa_ex` binary. The
following script should get you started:

    $ make
    $ SUDO_ASKPASS=/usr/bin/ssh-askpass make setuid

## Running

Start `iex` by running:

    $ iex -S mix

The `wpa_supplicant` daemon must be running already on your system. This shouldn't
be a problem on a laptop or desktop. If you're running on an embedded system
that doesn't automatically start it, do it manually before trying to start the
`WpaSupplicant` in Elixir. For example:

    iex> System.cmd "wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -C/var/run/wpa_supplicant -B"

After the `wpa_supplicant` starts, it's possible to start the
`WpaSupplicant` interface:

    iex> {:ok, pid} = WpaSupplicant.start_link("/var/run/wpa_supplicant/wlan0")
    {:ok, #PID<0.82.0>}

You can sanity check that Elixir has properly attached to the `wpa_supplicant`
daemon by pinging it:

    iex> WpaSupplicant.request(pid, :PING)
    :PONG

To scan for access points, call `WpaSupplicant.scan/1`. This can take a few
seconds:

    iex> WpaSupplicant.scan(pid)
    [%{age: 42, beacon_int: 100, bssid: "00:1f:90:db:45:54", capabilities: 1073,
       flags: "[WEP][ESS]", freq: 2462, id: 8,
       ie: "00053153555434010882848b0c1296182403010b07",
       level: -83, noise: 0, qual: 0, ssid: "1SUT4", tsf: 580579066269},
     %{age: 109, beacon_int: 100, bssid: "00:18:39:7a:23:e8", capabilities: 1041,
       flags: "[WEP][ESS]", freq: 2412, id: 5,
       ie: "00076c696e6b737973010882848b962430486c0301",
       level: -86, noise: 0, qual: 0, ssid: "linksys", tsf: 464957892243},
     %{age: 42, beacon_int: 100, bssid: "1c:7e:e5:32:d1:f8", capabilities: 1041,
       flags: "[WPA2-PSK-CCMP][ESS]", freq: 2412, id: 0,
       ie: "000768756e6c657468010882848b960c1218240301",
       level: -43, noise: 0, qual: 0, ssid: "dlink", tsf: 580587711245}]

To attach to an access point, you need to configure a network entry in the
`wpa_supplicant`. The `wpa_supplicant` can have multiple network entries
configured. The following removes all network entries so that only one is
configured.

    iex> WpaSupplicant.set_network(pid, ssid: "MyNetworkSsid", psk: "secret")
    :ok


If the access point is around, the `wpa_supplicant` will eventually connect to
the network.

    iex> WpaSupplicant.status(pid)
    %{address: "84:3a:4b:11:95:23", bssid: "1c:7e:e5:32:de:32",
      group_cipher: "TKIP", id: 0, key_mgmt: "WPA2-PSK", mode: "station",
      pairwise_cipher: "CCMP", ssid: "MyNetworkSsid", wpa_state: "COMPLETED"}

Polling the `wpa_supplicant` for status isn't that great, so it's possible to
register a `GenEvent` with `WpaSupplicant`. If you don't supply one in the call
to `start_link`, one is automatically created and available via `WpaSupplicant.event_manager/1`. The
following example shows how to view events at the prompt:

    iex> defmodule Forwarder do
    ...>  use GenEvent
    ...>  def handle_event(event, parent) do
    ...>    send parent, event
    ...>    {:ok, parent}
    ...>  end
    ...> end
    iex> WpaSupplicant.event_manager(pid) |> GenEvent.add_handler(Forwarder, self())
    iex> flush
    {:wpa_supplicant, #PID<0.85.0>, :"CTRL-EVENT-SCAN-STARTED"}
    {:wpa_supplicant, #PID<0.85.0>, :"CTRL-EVENT-SCAN-RESULTS"}

## Low level messaging

It is expected that the helper functions for interacting with the `wpa_supplicant`
will not cover every situation. The `WpaSupplicant.request/2` function allows
you to send arbitrary commands. Requests are atoms that are named the same as
described in the `wpa_supplicant` documentation (see Useful links). If a request
takes a parameter, pass it as a tuple where the first element is the command.
Parameters may be strings or numbers and will be properly formatted for the
control interface. The response is also parsed and turned into atoms, numbers,
strings, lists, or maps depending on the command. The string parsing is taken
care of by this library. Here are some examples:

    iex> WpaSupplicant.request(pid, :INTERFACES)
    ["wlan0"]

    iex> WpaSupplicant.request(pid, {:GET_NETWORK, 0, :key_mgmt})
    "WPA-PSK"
